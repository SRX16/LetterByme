                        <p>
                          Heyy! I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you. It really means a lot to have had someone like you around during this journey, you honestly helped keep me going by urging me to fix things in my academics. Without you, I would've felt hopeless, and i would have no reason to take action to get this far and visit in baguio. Iâ€™m so grateful to you.
